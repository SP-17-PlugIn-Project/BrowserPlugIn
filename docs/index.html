	<h3>Project Overview</h3>
	<p>Browser Extensions like Honey that provide coupons for the user are widely used, but many times are secretly predatory in nature. The purpose of this project is to create a browser that provides the best available coupons for some of the largest online shopping domains without employing any predatory practices against affiliate marketers or customers.  	</p>
	<p>he scope of this project includes planning, designing, developing, testing, and implementing a chrome-based browser extension that can store coupons available for some of the most popular online shopping domains, retrieving said coupons for the user when requested, and removing any nonfunctional coupons form the service, where users feedback will determine whether or not a code is still viable. The coupons will be gathered both via web scraping done via the team, as well as through an interface allowing users to input new coupons.</p>
